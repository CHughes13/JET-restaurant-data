## Introduction
The aim of this project is to create a responsive web application that allows users to search for local restaurants by postcode using the Just Eat Takeaway API. Results will display key information about the restauant in a clean, user-friendly layout. Results must include, at minimum:
- Restaurant name
- Type of cuisines
- Rating (as a number)
- Address

This web application was built by Christina Hughes - [GitHub](https://github.com/CHughes13), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chughes13/)

## Assumptions / Unclear
While Just Eat Takeaway provided a project brief, these are the following points that I found unclear and made my own assumptions about:

- Users search for restaurants by postcode.
- I assumed an API key would be provided â€” if not, mock data would be used.
- Features like pagination or advanced filtering were considered out of scope for MVP due to time constraints.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript
- [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) (for wireframes)

## UX/UI
### Site Goals
- Allow users to search for restaurants by postcode (10 to be shown).
- Display key restaurant data: name, cuisines, rating and address.
- Provide a clean, responsive and accessible layout.
- Prioritise mobile-first design...
- ... with a good user experience on tablet and desktop too.

### User Stories
The project brief did not specify a specfic user (customer, delivery driver, restaurant, in-house Just Eat team, etc.) so I opted to go with a customer as the user.

__As a user:__
- I want to search for restaurants near me using a postcode.
- I want to see useful information about each restaurant quickly. / I don't want to be overwhelmed by too much irrelevant information.
- I want to be able to sort/filter the data that appears so I can find exactly what I want, quickly.
- I want fast loading times.
- I want the website to work well on both mobile and desktop.

## Wireframes

Created using Balsamiq, here are the initial lofi wireframes for the project. These provide a visual outline of the planned layout and proposed functionality.

#### Mobile
Lofi wireframes to be added.

#### Desktop

## Features
This project was planned out using agile principles. I used the MoSCoW prioritisation method to determine which features were most important and a "must have" in order to meet the user's needs and achieve a MVP in this initial sprint.

### Existing Features
- Search by postcode form.
- Fetches and displays restaurant data from the Just Eat API.
- Displays: Restaurant logo, restaurant name, cuisine type/s, rating and address.
- Responsive layout for mobile, tablet and desktop.
- Error handling for invalid postcodes or no results found.

### Features Left to Implement
Using the MoSCoW method, it was determined that these features weren't essential to create a MVP but are more "should-have" and "could-have". Due to time constraintents these features were left out, but they would make great additions to the application in the future.

- **Sorting**: Sort results by rating or name.
- **Pagination**: To show more than just the first 10 restaurants.
- **Filters**: The ability to filter restaurants based on cuisine or rating.
- **Loading indicator**: A simple animation that lets the user know the search is in progress.
- **Map integration** To show the locations of the restaurants on a map (better for user).
- **Back to top button**: Quality of life feature. Saves having to scroll - a small issue, but annoying nontheless.

## Testing and Debugging

Testing was done throughout, both manually (by myself and outside testers) and using validators (see below).

### Manual Testing
Manual testing was performed throughout using console.log and console.error.

| Test | Expected Result | Actual Result	| Pass/Fail |
| ------ | ------------------- |----------------- |------------ |
|  Input valid postcode into the search bar (BS3 4AE) |  List of first 10 restaurants shown as individual cards |  Works as expected  |  Pass  |
|  Input invalid postcode into the search bar (BS3 4AE) |  Error message appears below search bar prompting the user to enter a valid postcode  |  Works as expected  |  Pass  |
|  Leave the search bar empty and then hit search button  |  Error message appears below search bar prompting the user to enter a valid postcode  |  Works as expected  |  Pass  |
|  Resize window to test layout responsiveness (mobile vs tablet vs desktop) |  List of first 10 restaurants shown as individual cards |  Works as expected  |  Pass  |
|  Ensure restaurant data is correctly displayed  |  Each restaurant's data (name, cuisine, rating, address) will be shown as a card in that order with the correct details | Works as expected  |  Pass  |
