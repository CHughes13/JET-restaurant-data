## Introduction
The aim of this project is to use the Just Eat API to find restaurant data and to display it in a web interface. Specifically:
- Name
- Cuisines
- Rating (as a number)
- Address

This web application was created and built by Christina Hughes - [GitHub](https://github.com/CHughes13), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chughes13/)

### User Stories

__As a user:__
- EXAMPLE: I want to register an account so that I can make a booking and keep track of my past/future bookings.
  - A user can create and register an account.
  - The user can then log in.
  - When the user is logged in they can make a booking.

## Features
This project was planned out using agile principles. I used the MoSCoW prioritisation method to determine which features were most important and a "must-have" in order to meet the user's needs and achieve a MVP in this initial sprint.

### Features Left to Implement
Using the MoSCoW method, it was determined that these features weren't essential to create a MVP but are more "should-have" and "could-have". Due to time constraintents these features were left out, but they would make great additions to the application in the future.

- __EXAMPLE__ - Should Have / Could Have

__Expectation:__ User will be prompted to input a valid postcode.  
__Result:__ Pass/Fail
